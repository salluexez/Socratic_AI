# Socratic AI

Socratic AI is a cross-platform learning system designed to solve a common problem in education: students often get quick answers, but not real understanding.

Instead of dumping solutions, Socratic AI guides learners through the **Socratic method**. The platform responds with questions, hints, reframing, and progressive scaffolding so students build the answer themselves and strengthen their reasoning in the process.

The project includes:

- a **Next.js web application**
- an **Express + MongoDB backend**
- a **Python AI tutor service**
- a **linked Android APK companion app** that connects to the same backend and learning data

## The Problem We Are Solving

Most learning tools optimize for speed, not mastery.

Students usually face one of these issues:

- they receive direct answers too early
- they become dependent on solution engines instead of reasoning
- they lose continuity between devices and study sessions
- they do not get meaningful feedback on progress, streaks, or learning patterns
- collaborative learning is awkward, fragmented, or missing entirely

Socratic AI addresses this by creating a guided tutoring experience where learners are nudged toward insight rather than being handed the final answer immediately.

## Our Solution

Socratic AI acts like a patient tutor that:

- asks guiding questions instead of immediately revealing solutions
- keeps students inside a structured hint-based flow
- tracks sessions, topics, and message history over time
- supports progress monitoring and streak building
- allows sessions to be shared across users
- works across **web and mobile** through a shared backend

The result is a learning assistant focused on **understanding, retention, and reflection** rather than shortcutting the process.

## Key Features

### 1. Socratic Chat Tutoring

- Subject-based AI tutoring sessions
- AI replies are designed to guide, not just answer
- Progressive prompting and hint-style interaction
- Topic generation from the student’s question
- Optional reveal-style mode through the tutor service
- Cross-session continuity through saved chat history

### 2. Authentication and User Accounts

- Sign up and sign in flows
- Secure password hashing with `bcrypt`
- JWT-based authentication
- Cookie-based session support on web
- Shared identity across connected clients

### 3. Personalized Dashboard

- Subject-first learning dashboard
- Recommended subject resume flow
- Recent learning sessions
- Dynamic statistics and study summaries
- Theme-aware UI that follows the user’s selected appearance

### 4. Subject Management

- Core subjects available by default
- Additional subjects can be enabled per user
- Learning areas currently include:
  - Mathematics
  - Physics
  - Chemistry
  - Biology
  - Computer Science
  - History
  - Political Science
  - Economics
  - Literature

### 5. Session History and Continuity

- Chats are saved to MongoDB
- Active sessions can be resumed
- Topic names can be edited
- Message history is preserved
- Recent learning sessions appear in the dashboard and subject pages

### 6. Shared Learning / Collaboration

- Share a chat session with another user by email lookup
- View sessions shared with you
- View sessions you shared with others
- Revoke individual or all access to a shared session

### 7. Progress Tracking

- Total sessions
- Estimated study time
- Streak tracking
- Weekly activity
- Subject distribution and mastery indicators
- Recent timeline of learning activity

### 8. User Profile and Preferences

- User profile display
- Profile updates
- Subject selection management
- Theme selection for the web application

### 9. Notification Support

The backend includes endpoints for notification token registration and preference management:

- register device token
- unregister device token
- enable/disable notification preferences

This supports the companion mobile experience.

## Web + Mobile APK Connection

This project is not only a web app.

An **Android APK companion app** was built for the same Socratic AI ecosystem and is connected to the same backend services. That means:

- the mobile app and web app can use the same user accounts
- both clients connect to the same API and database
- learning sessions can continue across devices
- the APK extends the system into an on-the-go study experience

In short, the APK is part of the same product vision: **one tutoring system, multiple entry points**.

## Architecture Overview

### Web App

The web frontend lives in `apps/web` and uses:

- Next.js App Router
- Zustand for client-side state
- Tailwind CSS
- Framer Motion

Main areas include:

- homepage
- login / signup
- dashboard
- learn overview
- subject chat pages
- progress
- profile
- settings
- shared topics

### Backend API

The backend lives in `apps/backend` and uses:

- Express
- Mongoose
- JWT auth middleware
- modular routes and controllers

Main API groups:

- `/api/auth`
- `/api/chat`
- `/api/user`
- `/api/sessions`
- `/api/notifications`

### Python Tutor Service

The AI tutoring service lives in `apps/script/socratic.py`.

It provides:

- Socratic response generation
- direct-answer/reveal mode
- topic title generation
- lightweight tutor orchestration for chat requests

The Node backend calls this service when processing tutor messages.

## Running the Project

### 1. Install dependencies

From the repository root:

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Start the monorepo

```bash
npm run dev

```bash
npm run dev:web
```

### 4. Run only the backend

```bash
npm run dev:backend
```

### 5. Run the Python tutor service

From `apps/script`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python socratic.py
```

## Environment Notes

The project expects environment configuration for:

- MongoDB connection
- JWT secret
- frontend URL / CORS origin
- Python tutor service URL
- Groq API key for the tutor service

Typical values used by the code:

- Web API base URL: `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`
- Backend tutor service URL: `PYTHON_SERVICE_URL`
- Python service key: `groq_api`

## Why This Project Matters

Socratic AI is not just another AI chat app. It is built around a specific educational philosophy:

- learning should be interactive
- students should be challenged, not spoon-fed
- progress should be visible
- study should continue seamlessly across web and mobile

The project brings together tutoring, persistence, personalization, and cross-platform access into a single system focused on **real understanding**.

## Conclusion

Socratic AI is a full learning platform that combines:

- a responsive web experience
- a connected Android APK companion app
- a secure backend
- a dedicated AI tutoring service
- collaboration, history, progress tracking, and personalization

The central mission of the project is simple:

**help students think better, not just answer faster.**
